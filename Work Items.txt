* Test framework with serialization
* Investigate simplifying support for entities that are children of aggregates
* Ensure framework does not hinder complex aggregate inheritence hierarchies and co/contra-variant interfaces
* Make IVisitableChildren contract pattern-based instead on nominally type-based
* Collapse all Visitor & Project "dispatch" logic into one helper (perhaps a general dispatcher in Commons)
* Implement real domain model in unit tests instead of convoluted abitrary model (e.g. MadScience/LabRat experiments)
* Add support for complex enums
* Work out proper Syntax/Symbolic model seperation (ie create a binder)
* Allow setting prefix/suffic for Ast generator
* Break out persistance providers into seperate assemblies/packages.
* Logical type registry should support open generics
* Move logical type system and serializer support into seperate assembly/package.

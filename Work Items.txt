* Test framework with serialization
* Investigate simplifying support for entities that are children of aggregates
* Ensure framework does not hinder complex aggregate inheritence hierarchies and co/contra-variant interfaces
* Move Visitor implementation into Commons
* Make IVisitableChildren contract pattern-based instead on nominally type-based
* Collapse all Visitor & Project "dispatch" logic into one helper (perhaps a general dispatcher in Commons)
* Implement real domain model in unit tests instead of convoluted abitrary model
